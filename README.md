TypeScript Typed Path Demo
===========================

使用typed-path这个库来定义一个typed path，可以对path进行typing check

```
npm install
npm run demo
```

Note:

`esModuleInterop` is recommended to set to `true`,
since we can have consistent importing syntax with babel,
always use:

```
import some from 'some'
```
